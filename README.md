# Black-Jack-Project

This project creates a playable game of Blackjack.
I created basic html and css files, with a more in-depth JavaScript file to facilitate the mathmatics, rules and animations responsible to make a true interactive game.

Files included are:
- index.html -> One of the three core files, responsible for the structure of the game
- style.css -> Another of the three core files, responsible for the design and style of the game
- script.js -> The main file, responsible for the workings and animations of the game.
- Assets file -> Holds images and music audio used in the game

To use and play the game, simply download all the above mentioned files, and run index.html.
